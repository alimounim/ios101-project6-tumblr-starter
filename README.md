# Project 6 - *Tumblr*

Submitted by: **Ali Mounim Rajabi**

**Name of your app** is an app that displays posts from the Humans of New York Tumblr blog. It fetches posts through the Tumblr API and shows them in a scrolling feed using a table view. Each post displays its main image, and when tapped, the app navigates to a detail screen where users can view the full photo and caption.
